- Package into single executable file. Easier to distribute. User doesn't need to install runtime environment and dependency libraries, which could be tedious for non-tech-savvy users.
- Add lightweight formatting to xlsx, widening cell to make text clear.
- Output excel file instead of csv file.
- Add progress indicator. Informative printing message.
- When searching for fund name, distinguish between fund and stock.
- Strip tqdm to minimal and copy to this repo.
- Try to use RESET api as much as possible. Avoid fetching web content which could be outdated or up to JavaScript modification. And it would be super tedious and engineering-wise difficult to up a whole JS engine to run JavaScript code.
- Add version as suffix to release assets and/or release executable.
- Instead of asking for override confirmation, just backup the old file and create the new file in-place.
- Add LICENSE
